# Orbiter Frontend v3.0 — AI Implementation Prompt & PRD
> Enterprise-Grade Agentic Workflow & Compliance System  
> Status: MVP (Round-1 Aligned, PS-5)

---

## 0. CONTEXT & OBJECTIVE (READ FIRST)

You are implementing the **frontend** for **Orbiter v3.0**, an enterprise-grade **Intelligent IT Compliance & Workflow Monitoring System**.
**One note that the UI is having too much white space reduce it a little it feels too much empty, use appropriate layouts but also make it look great.**
Orbiter is **NOT**:
- a simple dashboard
- a metrics viewer
- a chatbot demo

Orbiter **IS**:
- a system that continuously **observes, reasons, and explains**
- a UI abstraction over a **multi-agent autonomous backend**
- a product where **clarity > visual polish**

The backend already exists and is functional.  
The goal of this task is **frontend-first clarity**, not backend re-engineering.

⚠️ Important:
- The **existing UI design system is GOOD** and should be preserved.
- The **main issue** is how **graphs, charts, and information hierarchy** are implemented.
- Do NOT redesign visual style from scratch.
- Improve **experience, structure, flows, and explainability**.

---

## 1. HIGH-LEVEL GOAL

Build a frontend that allows a user (or judge) to clearly understand:
1. What is happening in the system
2. Why it matters
3. What actions are recommended
4. That the system is powered by **agents**, without exposing internal complexity

The frontend must feel:
- calm
- confident
- explainable
- enterprise-ready

---

## 2. FIGMA REFERENCE (SINGLE SOURCE)

Use **ONE SINGLE FIGMA BOARD** as inspiration for layout and interaction patterns only.

**Reference Board (example – replace with final MCP-linked board):**
@https://www.figma.com/design/mJKJ2VAQpSxHZkLHAsSNlO/orbitr?node-id=1-9&m=dev

Inspiration sources to combine conceptually:
- Elastic Security (audit + explainability)
- Datadog workflows (timeline clarity)
- Linear (clean hierarchy)

⚠️ Do NOT copy UI.  
Use it only to guide **spacing, layout, hierarchy, and interaction patterns**.

---

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (MANDATORY)

### Phase 1 — Understand Before Building
Before writing any code:
1. Explore the existing frontend codebase
2. Identify:
   - reusable components
   - current charting implementation
   - layout system
3. Write a **short plan** explaining:
   - what stays
   - what changes
   - what gets simplified

Only after this, start implementation.

---

## 4. PAGE-BY-PAGE FRONTEND PRD

---

### 4.1 Dashboard — System Awareness Screen

**Purpose**  
Instant system confidence. This page answers:
> “Is the system healthy and thinking?”

**Sections**
- System Risk Overview (Low / Medium / High)
- Active Workflows count
- Active Violations count
- Recent Activity Feed (text-first)
- Agent Activity Summary (collapsed by default)

**Rules**
- No heavy charts
- Prefer textual summaries
- Real-time feeling, not real-time obsession

---

### 4.2 Workflows — Core Monitoring Experience

**Purpose**  
Show how workflows are **monitored, compared, and reasoned about**

#### Workflow List View
- Workflow name
- Status badge (Normal / Delayed / Anomalous / Violation)
- Risk score
- Last updated time

#### Workflow Detail View (CRITICAL)
- Timeline view:
  - Expected vs Observed steps
  - Delays highlighted
  - Missing steps flagged
- Insight panel:
  - Detected deviations
  - Impact explanation
  - Linked events

This page proves **workflow intelligence**, not just monitoring.

---

### 4.3 Compliance & Policies

**Purpose**  
Demonstrate automated, explainable compliance.

#### Policy List
- Policy name
- Applies to (workflow / actor / resource)
- Status (active / inactive)
- Severity

#### Policy Evaluation View
- Policy triggered
- Evidence used
- Confidence level
- Linked workflow / event

⚠️ Policies are editable, but safely abstracted.

---

### 4.4 Events

**Purpose**  
Explain incidents, not just list them.

#### Events List
- Filter by severity
- Filter by type
- Filter by workflow / actor

#### Event Deep Dive (VERY IMPORTANT)
Sections:
1. Event summary
2. Findings by agent
3. Root cause explanation
4. Recommended actions
5. Simplified decision trace

This page must clearly show **reasoning**.

---

### 4.5 Agents (Read-Only)

**Purpose**  
Make agents visible without overwhelming users.

For each agent:
- Role
- What it monitors
- Recent contributions

⚠️ No configuration, no chat here.

---

### 4.6 Chat with Orbiter (Single Intelligence Interface)

**Purpose**  
Let users ask questions like:
- “Why is system risk high today?”
- “Which workflows are unstable?”

**Rules**
- One unified system voice
- Agent routing is invisible
- Responses link to relevant pages

NO multi-agent chat UI.

---

### 4.7 Analytics (Secondary)

**Purpose**
- Trends over time
- System-level understanding

Simple charts only:
- Risk trend
- Violations trend
- Workflow health distribution

---

### 4.8 Reports

**Purpose**
- Exportable, judge-friendly outputs

Types:
- Audit report
- Compliance summary
- Incident report

---

### 4.9 Settings & Simulation Control

**Purpose**
- Control the simulation cleanly

Features:
- Start / stop simulation
- Reset data
- Load scenario (optional)

---

## 5. MVP SCOPE LOCK

### MUST HAVE
- Dashboard
- Workflows (timeline-based)
- Events deep dive
- Compliance evaluation
- Unified chat interface

### NICE TO HAVE
- Policy editor
- Reports export

### DO NOT BUILD
- Multi-agent chat UI
- Deep infra metrics dashboards
- Over-configurable workflows

---

## 6. BACKEND ALIGNMENT PLAN (POST-FRONTEND)

After frontend completion:
- Review each page
- Identify missing APIs
- Add APIs **page-wise**, not system-wide

Frontend drives backend refinement, not the other way around.

---

## 7. REUSABILITY NOTE

This structure is **generic** and can be reused for:
- Security monitoring systems
- Workflow orchestration platforms
- Compliance engines
- Agentic enterprise software

Only agents and policies change — UX stays stable.

---

## FINAL NOTE TO THE IMPLEMENTING AI

You are not building a UI demo.
You are building **trust in an autonomous system**.

If something looks impressive but unclear — remove it.
If something looks simple but explains well — keep it.

Clarity beats cleverness.
